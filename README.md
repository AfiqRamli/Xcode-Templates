# Xcode-Templates
Xcode Templates allow you to create new projects with preset groups and folders.

# To Install
Simply put these folders into this location:
Macintosh HD > Users > [Username] > Library > Developer > Xcode > Templates > Custom

## Note:
 * You may have to create the "Custom" folder first.
 * Be sure to install the MVC Application.xctemplate too. Some of the templates require this template. 

# To Use
When you create a new Xcode project, scroll down and you will see a Custom section with these templates listed.
